# About
Just a little pet-project that is also a test objecxtive for my interview for work application, also as portfolio thing.

# What does it do

Nothing much. It just uses GitHub API to get info of any random users and their repositories and list it.
User also have the option to authorise in GitHub himself and look at his own info and repo's.
